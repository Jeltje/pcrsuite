<br>
Welcome to the new location of PCR Suite: a collection of programs that interact with
the Whitehead's 
<a href ="https://github.com/primer3-org">
Primer3 program</a>. <p>
<b>Please note:</b> This program is hosted by UC Santa Cruz but is not maintained by them. The author can be reached at jeltje.van.baren at gmail.com 
<p>
The original Primer3 program designs 
primersets for one sequence and it allows you to change almost every 
parameter. The PCR Suite has more stringent settings (to allow more 
working primersets) and a smaller range of parameters (because you won't 
change most of them anyway). 
<br>The suite consists of four programs:
<br><br>
<table bgcolor="#ffcc66" border=0 cellpadding=4>
<tr>
  <td width="20%"><a 
HREF="Overlapping_Primers.html">Overlapping_Primers</a> 
  <td>is for creating multiple overlapping PCR products 
    in one sequence. 
<tr>
  <td> <a HREF="Genomic_Primers.html">Genomic_Primers</a>
  <td>designs primers around exons in genomic sequence. All 
    you need is a GenBank file containing your gene. 
<tr>
  <td><a HREF="SNP_Primers.html">SNP_Primers</a>
  <td>designs primers around every SNP in a 
    GenBank file. 
<tr>
  <td><a HREF="cDNA_Primers.html">cDNA_Primers</a> 
  <td>designs primers around open reading frames. Simply upload 
    a GenBank file containing your genes.
